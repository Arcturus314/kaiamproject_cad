Br is 4000 gauss for ferrite magnet: https://www.supermagnete.de/eng/data_table.php

Calculate magnetic field strength from: https://www.supermagnete.de/eng/faq/How-do-you-calculate-the-magnetic-flux-density

Assuming magnet is 0.5 mm cube, z = 1mm

B = 71.6 gauss- outside of max fsd (8.1 gauss)

If we keep the pole face 3mm from the package we get 7.4 gauss field strength at the magnetometer

Assuming 0.5mm from top of package (package is 1mm thick). Sensor has min fsd of += 1.3G

With 400 gauss we want magnet directly on top of sensor package
